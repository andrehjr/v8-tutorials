    02 - Exposing global functions in v8.
        
        Verbosity is a nightmare when scripting, and often the most used
        functions should be named and easily accessible for scripters. 
        For example, the print/echo/log/etc function should be a globally
        accessible function with a short and easy to remember name. 

    This tutorial covers exposing functions directly as global functions.

Common: 
    What?
        A simple introduction to understanding the v8 javascript engine.
    Why?

Discussion :
    
    These examples will serve the simple purpose of demonstrating commonly 
    asked questions with regards to v8 and the embedding of javascript 
    into a c++ application.

    Disclaimer - I am no expert on v8. I just use it, and have hit the wall
    a number of times. Hopefully, anything I say will help you understand the
    mentality, concepts and structure of the v8 engine and how to use it based
    on the journey that I have travelled with the engine.
