04 - Exposing types into js with v8. 

        Also critical, the ability to make 'native' types exist in scripts.
        For example, unwrapping a texture or game class into js, or
        exposing a primitive like vec2 with native properties and code.
    
    This tutorial covers the basics of exposing types that can be instantiated
    on the javascript side.

    What?
        A simple introduction to understanding the v8 javascript engine.

    These examples will serve the simple purpose of demonstrating commonly 
    asked questions with regards to v8 and the embedding of javascript 
    into a c++ application.

    Disclaimer - I am no expert on v8. I just use it, and have hit the wall
    a number of times. Hopefully, anything I say will help you understand the
    mentality, concepts and structure of the v8 engine and how to use it based
    on the journey that I have travelled with the engine.

#include <iostream>
#include "../v8/v8.h"
#include "../common/common.h"
   //Include the print message function from the previous example
#include "../common/print.h" 
   //For seeing how to expose a class, view the header and cpp for vec2
#include "vec2.h"

using namespace v8;

    //Here will be a simple vec2 class, we will expose this as a native
    //javascript type, so that the following becomes possible in scripts.

        //var position = new vec2(10, 10);
        //print( position.length );
        //print( position.mul(10).length );

//The first step , is to set up a 'function' template. Objects in JS can be based on
//function templates, and usually it is a preferred approach with v8 as it offers more
//for the developer using it in c++.

    //So, we store a persistent template to reuse. When you
    //return a vec2() from c++ to js, you create a new instance
    //of one of these, and return that. This means you expose once,
    //and this becomes the factory for creating instances of vec2 objects.
Persistent<FunctionTemplate> Vec2Template;

void exposeVec2( Handle<ObjectTemplate> global ) {

         Locker lock;
         HandleScope scope;

            //Create the function template for the constructor, and point it to our constructor,
            //you can see this function inside vec2.cpp 
         Vec2Template = Persistent<FunctionTemplate>::New( FunctionTemplate::New( Vec2Constructor ) );

            //We can tell the scripts what type to report. In this case, just vec2 will do.
         Vec2Template->SetClassName(String::New("vec2"));
        
            //This template is the unique properties of this type, we can set 
            //functions, getters, setters, and values directly on each new vec2() object.
        Handle<ObjectTemplate> Vec2IT = Vec2Template->InstanceTemplate();

            //Again, this is to store the c++ object for use in callbacks.
        Vec2IT->SetInternalFieldCount(1);

            //These functions are in vec2.h and vec2.cpp, we are exposing the class type here.

        Vec2IT->Set( String::New("mul"), FunctionTemplate::New( InvocationCallback( vec2::MulCallback ) ));
        
            //Accessors are called everytime an assignment, or query is done on a property.
            //For example, position.length = 5; will call the Setter accessor. In this case,
            //you cannot set the length value, so any assignment is ignored inside the setter.
            //You can also leave it out, or pass 0 which means we don't
            //have a setter at all. When you use var len = position.length; it will execute the
            //callback specified on the getter. These callbacks differ from function callbacks, 
            //they have a different signature so be sure to note that.

        Vec2IT->SetAccessor( String::New("length"), AccessorGetter( vec2::GetLengthCallback ), AccessorSetter( vec2::SetLengthCallback ) );

            //Finally, we can tell the global scope that it now has a 'function' called vec2,
            //and that this function returns the template object above.
        global->Set( String::New("vec2"), Vec2Template );

    }

int main(int argc, char **argv) 
{

    Locker locker;
    HandleScope handle_scope;

    Handle<ObjectTemplate> globalTemplate = ObjectTemplate::New();

        //add the print function to the scope too
    exposePrint( globalTemplate );

        //Now, we expose (before the context) the type into the template.
    exposeVec2( globalTemplate );

        //Create our main context, we don't need to enter it now
    Handle<Context> context = Context::New( NULL, globalTemplate );
