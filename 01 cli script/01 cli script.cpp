01 - Command line script execution
    
    A simple primer to understanding the v8 workflow. This is not meant
    to do much more than print a result of a script execution. But, it 
    does demonstrate how to create a global template, a context, and 
    how the script file makes it's way from disk into the context.
    
    The scope of tutorial 1 is not to dig into those details, but a method
    of getting v8 running within minutes for you to mess around with.

Common: 
    What?
        A simple introduction to understanding the v8 javascript engine.

    These examples will serve the simple purpose of demonstrating commonly 
    asked questions with regards to v8 and the embedding of javascript 
    into a c++ application.

    Disclaimer - I am no expert on v8. I just use it, and have hit the wall
    a number of times. Hopefully, anything I say will help you understand the
    mentality, concepts and structure of the v8 engine and how to use it based
    on the journey that I have travelled with the engine.

        //repeatedly with little cost into new execution contexts.
        //Note the word template! It is a 'definition' of the context.
        //This is important to get - when you expose something into the
        //global object - it is an instance. When you expose something
        //onto the global template - ALL contexts can share the same 
        //exposed values without needing to redo the expose process.

        //A context is a fresh execution context. Take for example, 
        //a browser tab or frame in Google Chrome. Each of these are
        //a new context, stamped with a global template, and created
        //on demand. When executing scripts, you can execute them in 
        //and existing context by using the Context::context_scope 
        //handlers. This 'switches' context for that execution period
        
        //In this case, we only need one new context.
